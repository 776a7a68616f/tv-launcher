# TV Launcher

An attempt to create an open source launcher for the Android TV platform. The app is in an early stage and doesn't even
have a proper name yet.

## Features

- List all apps
- Show input sources (hdmi etc.) as apps

### Missing features

- "Watch Next" and other channels
  
  This feature would require the `com.android.providers.tv.permission.ACCESS_ALL_EPG_DATA` permission. Google decided
  that this permission should only be available for system apps.
